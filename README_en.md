## 🎁 Introduction
>`"i"` is currently conceived as both [i innovation](README_i_innovation.md) and [i language](README_i_il.md), and the `ibasicLibrary` will serve as the [i innovation](README_i_innovation.md ) as the underlying C++ library. The `ibasicLibrary` will also serve as the standard library used by the code/programs generated by [i innovation](README_i_innovation.md ) and related tools.
- Our goal is to make the `ibasicLibrary` cross-platform, functional, efficient, covering a wide range of areas, and all C++ standard C++ library.
